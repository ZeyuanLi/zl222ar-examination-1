            <h2>What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?</h2>
            <section>
                <p>The file robots.txt is a protocol used to control bots that scratch/scan websites to collect text and other data. In this file we can tell robots where to look for valuable information and which folder/pages to ignore. Nonetheless it should not be used as a security tool, since bots can ignore it. For this website I have added all my supporting folders containing .css .js and other files</p>

            <h2>What is humans.txt and how have you configure it for your site?</h2>
            <section>
                <p>The file humans.txt is a protocol used to give credit to website creators and designers without being too invasive. For instance here we can include web designers, graphic designers, writers, photographers, artists, UX designers and more. For this website I am the only authors so I only included my name!</p>

            <h2>What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?</h2>
            <section>
                <p>Open Graph is a tool/protocol used to share websites in social media. It allows to create a title add an image and description for more accurate display when sharing links on Facebook, Twitter and other social media.</p>

            <h2>Why is it important to separate the layout and design (css) from content (html)?</h2>
            <section>
                <p>This design allows to MVC (Model, View, Control) design pattern. If we have a large website it is a good idea to have design centralized in a single or a few .css files, this way if we decide to do some cosmetic changes we dont have to go over each pages one by one, but just made the relevant changes on the corresponding style sheet file.</p>
                <p>Moreover, if we want to change drastically the web platform, framework or other is good to have functionality, and GUI design well separated, this will make the work so much easier!</p>
